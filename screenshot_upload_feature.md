# Screenshot Upload Feature Documentation

This document provides an overview of the new screenshot upload feature for match verification.

## SQL Schema Changes

### Added Tables

- **match_screenshots**: Stores screenshots uploaded by users as proof of match results for standalone matches.
- **tournament_round_screenshots**: Stores screenshots uploaded by users as proof of tournament round results.

### Key Columns

- **image_path**: Path to the image stored in Supabase Storage.
- **upload_type**: Type of screenshot (e.g., result, kills, rank, final).
- **verified**: Whether admin has verified this screenshot.

### Development Notes

- **No Policies Required**: Since this is development mode, we won't implement storage policies
- **Storage Cleanup**: Screenshots will be deleted after matches/tournaments end to save storage (1GB limit on free plan)
- **User Restrictions**: Users cannot delete their own screenshots - only admins can manage deletion

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Supabase Storage Setup

1. **Create Storage Bucket**:
   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
   - Select your KGX project
   - Navigate to "Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New bucket"
   - Enter bucket name: `match-screenshots`
   - Set to **Private** (uncheck public)
   - Set file size limit: **5MB** (5242880 bytes)
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp`
   - Click "Create bucket"

2. **Add Database Tables**:
   - Go to "SQL Editor" in Supabase Dashboard
   - Copy and paste the contents of `/secure-database/add_screenshots_tables.sql`
   - Click "Run" to execute
   - Verify both tables are created: `match_screenshots` and `tournament_round_screenshots`

### Step 2: Frontend Integration

3. **User Upload Interface**:
   - Add screenshot upload functionality to match pages
   - Allow users to upload proof images with kill counts and rankings
   - Store file info in database tables

4. **Admin Verification Panel**:
   - Display uploaded screenshots in admin match scoring interface
   - Show images in table format for easy verification
   - Allow admins to mark as verified and add notes

### Step 3: Storage Management

5. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - Implement cleanup scripts to delete screenshots after matches end
   - Delete files from both Supabase Storage and database records
   - This helps manage the 1GB storage limit on free plan

## Run SQL

Execute the `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/KGX/secure-database/add_screenshots_tables.sql` file to add the tables.

## Conclusion

These changes will enhance match verification by allowing user-uploaded proof and providing admins with tools to verify match outcomes.
